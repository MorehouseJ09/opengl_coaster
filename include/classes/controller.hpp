	We want to have this controller class control the various splines for different pieces of the controller
	We will make sure that before hand, the splines line up properly based on the entrance / exit segments etc
	Then we will have a hash table of different elements which will each be their own instance of objects that inherit the basic spline drawing class		
	This class is responsible for being a singleton (later) and then controlling the redrawing etc of each elemnt	
	Need to create a global track element as well that will hold all of the hash points
